What is contained in this directory:
-The game's executable file along with its required resources as a .pck file. They must be within the same directory to run properly.
-The full godot project of the game, including source code and assets.
-The feedback from  each of the members of the dev team, including feedback from their playtests of this game, and their playtests of others games.

Alternatively, if the user does not use Windows and/or can't run the game using the .exe, an itch.io link is provided in the "itch_io_link.txt" file.
The HTML file to run the game exists in the raw project directory but it can't be used by the user without a webserver, so using the itch link is recommended.


The itch.io page for the game has custom dimensions to fit the game nicely. Fullscreening may warp the game in a strange way due to how HTML5 exports work in Godot.
Therefore, it is recommended to keep the dimensions as is, if the user desires to see more or less, they can zoom out using their computer's/browser's zoom function.

Enjoy!
